# A Novel Narrative on Neural Networks
[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/captainsafia/novel-narrative-neural-networks)

This GitHub repository contains the data and the interactive notebooks that are required for my class on neural networks. The interactive notebook
follows the use of a multilayer perceptron with backpropoagation and single hidden layer with a sigmoid activation function. The interactive notebook covers the use of `scikitlearn-neuralnetwork`, cross validation scoring, and use of the matplotplib plotting library.

The data used in this dataset consists of the MNIST data set. A dataset of handwritten digits for optical character recognition.
